Exercise 1 for Web Development 2025

## Struggles and Challenges

One thing I really struggled with was forcing the footer to the bottom, even if the page didn't reach the bottom. After much googling and looking over my notes from the practical sessions I managed to get it to work. 

For some reason the 'Accommodation' heading on the index.html file wasn't formatting correctly. I think I Have fixed it for the most part.

I also struggled with ensuring the website was mobile compatible, especially on the `visit.html` page. I got around the requirements for needing a 7:3 column ratio by ensuring that when the width of the screen is smaller than a specified amount, it renders it under each other to ensure it still is readable on a mobile device. 

## Navigation

I am most proud of this navigation bar actually, I like how sleek and modern it looks. I also like how the text turns to grey for the page that you are on to give feedback to the user about what page they are on.

## Colours

As for the colours I used what I thought looked nice. The use of grey for the main page and white for the navigation bar, as well as black for the footer gives it a nice contrast that is easy to read and is modern. 

## Layout

The layout is quite standard. I did experiment with adding a background image and a page over the image but I felt it looked a bit tacky, and I couldn't find the right image for it to work properly. What I have ended up with though I feel is a sleek and modern design.
